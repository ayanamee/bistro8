My first Pico-8 endeavor is a clone of the well known cellular automaton slash zero-player game Conway's Game of Life. 
I chose to remake Game of Life, because I thought the pixel-perfect nature of Pico-8 lends itself very nicely to systems represented by grids. 
It also has very simple rules, I didn't need fancy data structures or algorithms nor any familiarity with Lua.
It's fun to mess around for a while, the chaotic chain reactions mesmerize me.

X - Populates/Depopulates a cell
Z - Runs/Stops simulation
